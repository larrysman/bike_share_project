# bike_share_project
In this project, I performed the following: 

  - Train a model to predict the total rentals for any given day.
  
  - Implementing gradio to deploy the model in production.
  
  - Build model that predict the no of registered and casual rentals. 
  
   - Using binning techniques on the cnt column, build a classification model to predict binned values of rentals and deploy the model.
